## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is a premier platform for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a vast collection of problems that help developers enhance their algorithmic skills.

## Project Overview

This repository is a collaborative effort by [@sofia-petruk](https://github.com/sofiapetruk) Mine mission is to solve one LeetCode problem each day, documenting our solutions and explanations to foster learning and growth.

## Getting Started

To contribute to or use this repository, you'll need to set up your environment first. The project uses Python to fetch and process LeetCode problems.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sofiapetruk/leetcode-challenge.git
   cd leetcode-challenge
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
    python -m venv .venv

    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Using the Problem Generator Script

The repository includes a script to automatically fetch problems from LeetCode and create the directory structure:

1. Run the script

   ```bash
   python get_problem.py
   ```

2. Enter the LeetCode problem ID when prompted

   ```
   Digite o ID do problema: 1
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Fetch the problem details from LeetCode
   - Create the necessary directory structure
   - Generate description files in both English and Portuguese
   - Create a template solution file in Python

### Directory Structure

After running the script, a new problem directory will be created following the repository structure pattern:

```
problems/
└── solutions/
    └── 0001-two-sum/
        ├── en/
        │   ├── description.md
        │   └── explanation.md
        ├── pt/
        │   ├── descricao.md
        │   └── explicacao.md
        └── solution.py
```

Now you're ready to solve LeetCode problems and contribute to the project!

## Summary

Here you will find the summary of all the problems we have solved. Each problem is documented with its description, solution, and explanation.

To view the full summary of all exercises, simply access the [`summary.md`](problems/summary.md).

If you wish to filter problems by difficulty, you can check the following files:

- **Easy Problems**: [`easy.md`](problems/easy.md)
- **Medium Problems**: [`medium.md`](problems/medium.md)
- **Hard Problems**: [`hard.md`](problems/hard.md)

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory, containing:

- **description.md**: The problem statement.
- **explanation.md**: A detailed explanation of the approach and logic used.
- **solution.py**: The implemented solution in Python.
- **solution.xx**: The implemented solution in any other language.

## Multilingual Support

To cater to a broader audience, we provide documentation in both English and Portuguese. The structure for each problem is as follows:

```
├── problems
│   └── solutions
│       ├── 001-two-sum
│       │   ├── en/
│       │   │   ├── description.md
│       │   │   └── explanation.md
│       │   ├── pt/
│       │   │   ├── descricao.md
│       │   │   └── explicacao.md
│       │   ├── solution.py
│       │   └── solution.xx
```

This format ensures consistency and makes it easy to navigate through the problems we've tackled in both languages.

## Our LeetCode Statistics

We utilize the [LeetCode-Stats-Card](https://github.com/JacobLinCool/LeetCode-Stats-Card) todisplay our current statistics. Here are our individual stats:
